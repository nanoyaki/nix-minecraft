#NOTES
# my research seems to suggest forge can come in 3 varieties:
# ancient: this version only happens with *very* old versions (pre 1.5) and 
#    I *think* is just files to drop over the client.jar. very old method and one
#    we can probably save till the other two are working
# universal: This version comes with two files, universal.jar, and installer.jar
#    the first is the actual forge launcher, while the latter grabs the files
#    and libraries needed first.  I *think* the needed files are listed in
#    version.json inside the installer, and universal.jar is able to be
#    grabbed seperatly, so we don't need to fetch the installer during install
#    only when updating the lock files (which hopefully is never an issue, since
#    forge doesn't use this format anymore)
# modern: This version is just the installer.jar, and does some funky stuff to
#    finish the install, namely patching the actual client.jar directly
#    rather than using the pre-1.13 methods.  This one needs some work to make
#    happy, including patching the install_profile.json to remove the mapping
#    download step (because it doesn't work in a hermetic environment), and
#    stripping the hashes to make java happy.  We also need to fetch libraries as
#    with the above one, but the number of libraries is *massive*, so proper cache
#    is essential.  I'm also not 100% sure what patching methods are needed for each one,
#    so they may need some attention for current and future builds.
